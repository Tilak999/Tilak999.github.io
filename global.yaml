bio: I'm <b>Tilak Sasmal</b>, a full-stack developer based in Pune, India. I'm a developer
  who also designs. I primarily code in python and node.js but switching languages

  that makes an impact on people's lives.<br/><br/>Other than, coding and design I'm
  an avid learner, dreamer and builder. Some of my favourite pass time activities
  are listening to music, watching shows and learning new things. I am also an open-source
